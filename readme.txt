This plugin enables Google partners to add the Google Partners dynamic badge to their site with no hassle.

== Description ==

Google requires all its partners (advertising agencies) to show the Google partner certification badge on their site. Since the badge involves some coding, it might be difficult to embed it on WordPress site. That's why I've created this plugin to help Google partners adding the badge easily to their site on pages, posts, widgets etc.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->"Partners Dynamic Badge" to enter the Settings page.
4. In the setting screen, enter your Google Partner ID. This ID can be found in google.com/partners/ site. Once logged-in, Click the "Partner Status" menu on the left, and then click the "Get The Badge" link. Then, you'll see an 8-10 digits code. That's the code you should insert below.
5. Save the settings.
6. Put the shortcode [gpbadge] anywhere on your site to show the badge.
7. The badge will work only on sites that are connected to your Google Partner profile. To make sure, please go to Google Partners site, under "My Company" and make sure your site is listed.
